# java-pattern-programs
Hi my name is Kaustav , from India . I realised there is life beyond studies . i love programming a lot. Currently i am in class 9 , learning Java basics , loops , branching , selection.
There are students who don't even understand program .
This is to help them know how loop works.It's a critical topic, but if interpreted carefully , it becomes easy for many.
